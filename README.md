# MatlabCode_For_Paper
Reproduce the codes for the papers or the books which I have  read and understood .
The code repository is mainly made up of the Matlab codesÔºÅ
List for the repository:
1. robust_filtering.m :
   
	PaperName: Robust filtering for discrete-time systems with bounded noise and parametric uncertainty
	Noting: To solve the sdp problem for the iterable process, I call cvx to solve it efficiently. In order to run robust_filtering.m successfully, you must download the cvx solver made by S.Boyd,who is a professor in Standford University and famous for his course named convex optimization.
